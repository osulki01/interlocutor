This article was published in the Guardian the day after It was a quite extraordinary end, but it was in keeping with everything important that had gone before. There was a continuity, not only in the texture of these events but in the circumstances of her long life and swift demise. Just as her triumphs were often rooted in her zest for combat, her refusal to listen to advice and her unwillingness to admit that she could be wrong, so were these the sources of her last predicament. Until yesterday, when all three habits were finally broken. It is a shocking way to go. Having lost no vote either in the Commons or in the country, she was yet disposed of by the unaccountable will of fewer than 400 politicians. There has been nothing like it in the democratic era: no verdict apparently so perverse and unprovoked delivered by a governing party against a leader upon whom it had fawned and under whom it had grown fat for so many years. Many Conservatives will be thunderstruck by what they accomplished yeterday some, even among those who did the deed, will be ashamed. For the first time in her prime ministership she provoked, while not requesting it, the human sympathy reserved for a helpless creature at bay. The symmetry between the life and the death was nonetheless compelling. She was a leader of lurid style and risky habits, especially in the field of personal relations. Aggressive to a fault, she spent years scorning not only consensual policies but the consensual demeanour. With nerveless indifference, she was prepared to see the larger portion of her friends as well as enemies in high places depart the scene as a direct result of her behaviour. A kind of rough justice therefore now prevails, its chemistry precipitated by the most enduring victim of these gross habits, Geoffrey Howe. She who lived by fire and insult cannot wholly complain when the ultimate insult repays her. These have, however, been years which will not be forgotten. The Callaghan era might never have happened, for all that history makes of it. This is less true of the periods to which Harold Wilson and Ted Heath attach their names, but what lingers from them is notoriety more than fame. The Thatcher era will be different, and nowhere more so than in the evidence it offers that personality can be the single most potent contributor to the pattern of events. For better or for worse, this will truly and for ever be called the Thatcher Era. She was a creature of her times. Although as a minister under Heath she showed an opportunist's capacity to find different times congenial enough, from the mid-Seventies she rode the tide of liberal economics and anti-state politics with missionary aplomb. All reformers need circumstance to coincide with destiny. But character matters more. There were things that happened which would, I think, have happened quite differently without her. The first was the Falklands War. It was a prime example of ignorance lending pellucid clarity to her judgment. Surrounded by ministers who knew what war was and dithered at its prospect, she understood what the soldiers wanted and shirked neither the military consequences not the huge political risk. This quality of leadership was justly rewarded. She was, in fact, especially decisive in war. But for her it is also certain that American bombers would not have been allowed to bomb Libya from British bases in April 1986. Second, the conduct of economic policy in the early Eighties owed almost everything to her moral fibre. It may have been a failed policy, but it was hers. She was committed to an economic theory and committed against caring about unemployment. When Lord Hailsham told her, in July 1981, that she would destroy the Conservative Party as surely as Herbert Hoover led the Republicans to oblivion in 1932, she spat in his eye. Blood on the streets did not alarm her, any more than the self-starvation of Irish republicans. She worried not about the jobless masses but the looted shopkeepers: a priority which, nine years later, no longer seems odd. Third, and for similar reasons, the dethroning of trade union power would have taken a different course without her. She acted out with utmost seriousness the anti-union prejudice which most other Tories shared but which many of them had not dared to deploy. Public sector strife, culminating with the 1984 coal strike, was permitted to drag out as ministers watched with almost sadistic fascination. But without the gimlet eye of their leader upon them, their record suggests that they would have lost their nerve well before the desired 'demonstration effect', which always mattered more than the money, was achieved. With Mrs Thatcher 's fourth irreplaceable mark, we reach more contentious territory: the region, in fact, where hubris and nemesis met, to ultimately catastrophic effect. Few qualified observers doubt that her stand against the European Community achieved a British advantage in the early days, which was unavailable by other means. By asking reasonable questions in a wholly unreasonable manner, she secured more of 'our money' from Brussels. A decade's combative diplomacy made for a quite different British presence. Arguably, we counted for more in Europe, in a constructive as well as critical role, in 1985 than in 1975. But here came the first source of her trouble. The mark in Brussels became a kind of curse at home. Her elemental convictions about nationhood and sovereignty were not accompanied by sufficient sensitivity to the opposite feelings of significant colleagues. The issue became an emblem of the style as well as the content at the heart of her difficulties. It showed the falsity of this distinction. With this leader the style was the woman. In modified form, this was also a key to her fifth uniquely personal policy, the poll tax. It is the only tax in the western world to have grown more out of character than reason. Reason, expressed by Nigel Lawson and the Treasury, said that it would be unjust, unworkable and insupportably expensive. Character, sticking blindly with a Thatcher commitment dating from 1974, insisted that it must go forward and enlisted another consistent trait of these years the incautious support of enough meekly compliant ministers for the blame to be spread. POLICIES alone, however, do not define the place she will take in the annals. The intangibles are perhaps more important, and may ensure her name a longer life. Thatcherism embodies a style and a set of values that will take a long time to disappear from British politics. At the least, they may be the model of what to avoid: a memory studiously honoured in the breach. More likely, they will endure as an example others cannot neglect. As a leader, she developed abrasiveness into an art form. She despised, above all, consensus: the goal of most other leaders but not her. She inveighed against it with as much vigour in November 1990 as she did before she became Prime Minister. As a leader, also, she needed to know everything and often seemed to do so. There never has been a leader better briefed, with readier riposte, more scornfully deployed against her ignorant enemies. This most formidable capacity was some kind of answer to those who charged her, accurately, with an insatiable desire to interfere in every minister's business. Hardly anything moved in Whitehall without her approval but for hardly anything that happened did she fail to have a detailed justification. As well as this ambiguous virtue, however, she had a plainer one. She did not want to be liked. The least likeable of all leaders, according to consistent opinion poll findings, she nonetheless won three elections. In this she was wholly admirable. She did not pander to the people. They often remarked on how much they hated her, even as they admitted to a grudging respect. This quality, often described as a flaw, did much for the moral calibre of our politics. No other leader in our time, I guess, will be so easily willing to resist the desire to please. She used this harshness to establish a more prominent British presence in the world. Of all the people bewildered by what has happened, none flounder in deeper astonishment than foreigners from all over. For most of them, Margaret Thatcher has given a passable imitation of the Britannia whom, during the Falklands crisis, she shamelessly sought to personify. Before her, a series of faceless men, usually in grey suits, trod the global stage pretending to an influence that depended on past glories some of them could almost remember. They rarely said or did anything worthy of report on an inside page of the New York Times. In the Thatcher era, the image has been different. During the Reagan years, moreover, image proclaimed more than mere appearance. Through their shared ideology, they formed a society for the mutual support of leaders determined to abolish the post-war consensus. Mrs Thatcher visited Washington often, was invariably feted and, if an election year loomed, notionally drafted for the presidency. She had a very special relationship with Mr Reagan and, as the interlocutor with Mr Gorbachev, a special role in the dialogues that led to the ending of the Cold War. When that ice age broke up, moreover, it was to the Thatcher model that many of the newly free countries consciously turned for guidance on the modalities of the free market. All this was due to her personal charisma. Evangelism and showmanship captured the east, beginning in the Soviet Union shortly before the 1987 election. Some might say that the influence thereby attained was a little illusory. How could a weak country like Britain aspire to change the world, especially when Germany was becoming so manifestly the dominant power in Europe? But that only serves to reinforce the Thatcherite point: without her peculiar quality of conviction, proclaimed by her flamboyant personality, Britain would have continued to take its proper place as an increasingly obscure island off the shore of north-west Europe. It is a destination her successor will have the greatest difficulty in avoiding. So this defiance of historic inevitability may not last long. There were signs of it waning well before she fell. Developments in both east and west were beginning to relegate Britain back into the second division. What the lady spoke for at home, on the other hand, could expect a longer shelf-life. It was here that her legacy had best chance of surviving, if only because some of it has been seized by her opponents. SHE SPOKE, as no one else did, for business Britain. Not just for big business but, rather more, for small. Detached from her party, she could easily have been a latter-day Poujadist, expressing the economic but also the social philosophy of little-England shopkeeping, the world from which she sprang. In entrepreneurship, in profit-making, in market-place success she saw the unalterable foundations of a successful society. She never deviated from this philosophy, and never tired of reiterating its principles as a guide to human conduct. Doubted and even despised during the Seventies, these at last became conventional wisdom in the Eighties. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the Labour Party. Arguably, the new model Labour Party was one of her most important creations. She often vowed not to leave politics until socialism had been scorched off the face of Britain. One more term, she thought, would finally disabuse the country as well as Labour that the politics of the left had any future. A pseudo-socalist Labour Party has outlived her, which she will deeply regret. But the pseudery is significant. In Labour rhetoric, the virtues of private property and market economics have replaced ancient promises to dismantle the integument of the capitalist system. By departing, Mrs Thatcher may have removed Mr Kinnock's favoured electoral target: but she leaves an Opposition more anxious to retain than remove a fair amount of what she has done. She also leaves an economy which, for all their railing, is stronger than it was. Maybe the most history will be able to say is that the Thatcher years decelerated British decline. Certainly the wondrous miracle, which many of her former colleagues were pointing to in their obituary tributes yesterday, takes its reality only from an assumption about where we might have been without the medicine she administered in the early Eighties. Even so, if we grant that all political careers can be said to end in failure, with their grand promises never fully achieved, this career can nonetheless be deemed less of a failure than many. There were failures, however. And of many candidates for consideration, two strike me as reaching close to the heart of the Thatcher experience. Just as there were positive events unattainable without her, so were there the negative: specific and peculiar to her person. The first concerned her attitude to government itself, and in particular the role of the state. She came into power determined to reduce it. Most Tory leaders have said as much, but she was the first who announced a conscious mission to abandon paternalist aspirations and get government, even benign government, off the people's backs. This was conspicuously accomplished in only one department, that of state ownership. The privatising of productive business will never be reversed, and even the utilities are likely, under Labour, to remain outside the public sector. Selling council houses and cheap shares in gas switched a few million people from being clients of Labour, as the party of public ownership, to being clients of the capitalist party. But elsewhere, Mrs Thatcher 's relations with the state ended in confusion, futility and contradiction. One of her famous axioms was that no such thing as society existed: which postulated a dismantling of the collective institutions that propped society up. This did not happen. Her sentiment was widely regarded with ridicule and incomprehension, even among her own supporters. Society at large showed no inclination to assume its disintegrating role. Quite the opposite. Every test of public opinion showed that in her didactic task, of persuading people that the state could not be benign, she failed. But her actions, also, countermanded her ambition. In the Thatcher years, there were many ways in which the central state grew more not less powerful. In finance, in education, in health services, the edicts of the centre overrode those of the locality, as local government was substantially undermined. She was aware of this paradox. In schools and hospitals, a species of market choice was supposed to stand substitute for local democracy. But in the end the gentlemen, and un-gentlewoman, in Whitehall knew best. We were told that this would be temporary. But a government of different temper will find a lot of new instruments in place, the tools of Mrs Thatcher 's rage for action, conveniently ready for use. ADD to this the curtailments of civil liberties, notably concerning free expression, and the Thatcher era will go down as one in which state power increased. All Tory leaders have been vigilant in defence of the state's policing power. But a special edge was given this trait by this prime minister. Her own experience with terrorism, always an underrated aspect of her psyche, made her an unyielding proponent of media curbs which touched upon it. She was in favour of freedom as long as it could be paid for: a less reliable defender of the intangible liberties of man. The second failure concerned, in the end, her view of what political leaders were meant to be and do. She had the vices of her virtues. This was what finally engulfed her. She was strong, but put excessive weight on strength. She accumulated more personal power than any peacetime prime minister in history and in that guise will interest the constitutional historians for many years. But she saw too little value in the art of compromise. Leadership, for her, was equated too often with the satisfaction of her will. How often, when challenged with being overmighty, did she deride the notion of a leader who gave precedence to other virtues than strength. She was a conviction politician, but too often scorned the reasoned statement of different convictions, sometimes by her closest colleagues. Argument she relished, as long as she won, but persuasion she neglected. Give-and-take and the other techniques of sweet reason were alien to her nature. This made for abrasive and often decisive government, but it was fatally disabling for any kind of collective leadership. For surprisingly many years, it wrought no lasting damage. The collective was willing to put up with its uncomradely supremo because, essentially, it was persuaded that she was going in the right direction: and in any case she kept on winning elections. But at the end, over Europe, the one issue on which the Conservative Party was prepared to concede that it is most seriously divided, the obedience of the collective beginning with Nigel Lawson and ending with Geoffrey Howe, and not forgetting the destruction wrought by Nicholas Ridley in between collapsed. Behind Mrs Thatcher 's political method lay a vision of Britain but, perhaps more importantly, also a vision of herself. Although insecurity was never entirely missing from her makeup, it coexisted with even less confidence in the ability of anyone else to do what she was doing. For many years she thought she was irreplaceable, a judgment which grew not out of simple vanity so much as an assessment of Britain's plight and what she could contribute to it. When the tumbrils began to roll two weeks ago, she still could not credit that this verdict was being revised. Nor could many other people. Some still cannot. Having broken the rules and beaten the system often in the past, she seemed capable of doing it again. It was almost an offence against nature to suppose that she could not. But finally the system, which says that this is cabinet and not prime ministerial government, reacted. There was a point beyond which it declined to be flouted. This point was identified by an age-old reflex: the perception that an election was about to be lost and power surrendered to the other side. No fear exceeds that of politicians faced with the loss of office, not even fear of the avenging virago across the table. So in the end, in a drama whose outlandishness aptly reflected the years before, she went."
