We can all, I think, understand the great sense of loss that the country felt upon the sad announcement this week of the death of Captain Sir Tom Moore, a man who achieved more in the months around his hundredth birthday than most of us could ever accomplish in several lifetimes. He was a cheerful and stoic old soldier, one of a dwindling band of survivors of the Greatest Generation, whose ‘tomorrow will be a good day’ catchphrase managed the rare feat of sounding genuine rather than nicked from a Hallmark card. Yet I would contest that there was even more to Captain Tom than has hitherto been eulogised. Surely one of the many factors contributing to this lovely gentleman’s phenomenal appeal – both literal and metaphorical – was the fact that he tapped into the great British fondness for, and famously generous response to, kindly people doing benignly pointless things for a good cause. Cast your mind back to the Before Times of 2019 and earlier: wasn’t there always someone encouraging you to pay a pound for charity to guess how many nails there were in a jar, or asking you to sponsor their kids while they did 20 laps of their paddling pool? As I recall it, in the 1980s there were endless stories of people sitting in baths of baked beans for hours/days/weeks on end in order to fundraise and the British public responded to the heroic pointlessness of these challenges with philanthropic gusto. In fact, it seemed that the more esoteric the task, the deeper our collective pockets became. I don’t ever remember one of our local community sponsored litter picks – useful! Tidy! Fewer discarded takeaway cartons littering Epping Forest! – sparking anywhere near such an enthusiastic response. Maybe it was just the children I hung out with growing up, but our sponsored silences always managed to rake in the cash for charity. One of the myriad minor-key privations that we have suffered as a country over this past time-out-of-time year is the chance to participate in acts of small-scale community benevolence. There have been no Cub Scouts washing cars for charity, no Brownie cookie bakes, no school or village fetes, which meant that my extraordinary run of luck at the bottle-jar tombola – a jar of elderly jam? Yes please! – went untested in 2020. I shudder to think how many kindly-intentioned but nonetheless inedible cakes went unmade and unsold last year, and thus how much money went unraised for all manner of good causes. No wonder charities across the board are now reporting dwindling income and curtailed spheres of operation. One of our most appealing national characteristics has long been our generosity; one of the most cherishable statistics I know concerns the UK’s charitable giving in those terrible days immediately following the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004, when we as a country out-donated the rest of Europe put together. This instinctive kindness of ours has had precious few outlets in the past year, which is why Captain Sir Tom and his laps of his garden struck such an almighty chord. It is fervently to be hoped that as the vaccine roll-out gathers momentum across 2021, so do announcements of fairs and festivals, bazaars and bring-and-buy sales, with their multiple opportunities to chuck soggy sponges at teachers and vicars who stand gamely in the stocks in the name of raising funds for skew-whiff church steeples across the land. We owe it to Captain Tom and his inspiring legacy to carry on walking the path of resilient, unshowy generosity – and if we’re really good, there might even be a home-made scone with some jam of dubious provenance to reward us for our efforts when we finish. That, or a relaxing bath of baked beans to sooth aching muscles."

Now, of course, CBD oil is about as rowdy as it gets. I’m awake in the mornings – sometimes before Saturday Kitchen! I know what time the sun goes down – and to charge my bike lights just in case. I know whether or not we have marjoram in the cupboard – and what to use it for. I know which birds are in the garden.  I know what page I’m on. What I do not know – or didn’t, until a recent epiphany – is what on earth I did with my weekends “before”. Before the walks and the laminated dough, before I learned that supreme cardinal virtue of “making the most of the day” which proved my twenties – my youth, my prime, my hot years, my fertile years – had been time well spent. Before all that – was I really just in bed? Yes, obviously, because I’d been out all night! And it was glorious. I used to complain about how tired I was, that my weekends were signed off months in advance to other people’s birthdays and engagements and hens, mumble sheepishly on a Monday morning that I hadn’t seen daylight since Friday, wish, wish for that personality transplant that would make me “together”, “controlled”, “responsible”, “financially solvent” – a real adult, in other words. But I refuse now to see that a productive, predictable lifestyle is a more valuable one than mine. I long for all that rush, and rushing around, the chaos, even the regret, the head in the loo and the paracetamol and the days of crying and panicked texts that often followed. I miss that freedom of the dark, barrelling around London on the night tube at five in the morning and feeling (wrongly) invincible, or, after several deep breaths, marching into a packed pub full of someone else’s friends, and the house parties until dawn, after that.  I miss the mischievous, menacing conspiracy of a “rogue one”, of “seeing where the night takes us”, and cramped bogs and lost numbers and risky decisions, 24-hour garages and kebab shops and casinos and karaoke and crap Uber ratings, and checking Google Maps to work out where you’d woken up. The excitement of trying, for a night, to live without thinking about the consequences. Even the peer pressure, that dragged me out against my will, at least gave me something to talk about. Of course I felt dead most of the time – or close to it. But I was never more alive."
